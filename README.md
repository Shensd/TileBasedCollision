# Tile Based Collision
An example of a tile based 2D collision engine.

## What does it do?
It is still in very early stages of development, but it will mostly be used as a way to create 2D platformer games with simple controls and gameplay. 

## How does it work?
It is written in C++ with [Allegro 5](http://liballeg.org/) as the graphics base. The collision it self works on a tile based system. A map file (example shown below) is loaded and turned into an array of tiles, which can be found from a given x,y coordnate to determine if it is solid. This can then be used to create simple platform collision in relation to a player.

## What are the future plans?
Right now this is in incredibly early stages of development, so there is a lot to still be added. The biggest items would be more tile types on the maps, and a bit more flexibility in how the physics are calculated. Right now the physics don't allow for a lot of variety in movement so it is a goal to add more customizability in that area. Plans for more tiles include adding attributes to individual tiles. The idea is that a tile would be given a character for parsing and then that tile would be given it's own attributes, such as player speed on contant and varying level of solidity.
